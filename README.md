Simulator:  A Flutter simulation of the N-Body problem for instructional use

This application does a numerical simulation of the N-Body problem from
astronomy.  It sits nicely at the intersection of computer science,
numerical analysis, physics and astronomy, with a dash of software 
engineering.  Hopefully, it shows that Flutter is a good vechicle for
playing around with ideas in a highly graphical way, with an example 
that has almost no UI.

The repository is tagged with release numbers, so that incremental
development can be simulated in a classroom setting or a presentation.
`flutter checkout v7`, for example, lets you see the seventh version
of this highly incrementally-developed simulation.
