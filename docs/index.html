<code>n_body</code> Flutter program
</h1>
<p>
Hello!  This web site to introduces the <code>n_body</code> program.  This
is a little program written in Flutter, meant to inspire people learning
programming.  This program plays with physics, astronomy, orbital dynamics,
and numerical simulation.  It can be built for the web, for desktop (MacOS,
Windows and Linux), and as a mobile app (Android or Ios).
<p>
You should be able to run the application, at
<a href="run/">https://billf-pshs.github.io/n_body/run/</a>, or by clicking
the image below.

<h2>About the Source Code</h2>
The source code for this program is available at
<a href="https://github.com/billf-pshs/n_body">https://github.com/billf-pshs/n_body</a>.
If you're not familiar with Flutter and Github, all this can look a little
intimidating at first.  The actual program is just one file,
<a href="https://github.com/billf-pshs/n_body/blob/main/lib/main.dart"><code>lib/main.dart</code></a>.
It's about 300 lines long.

You might notice another source file:
<a href="https://github.com/billf-pshs/n_body/blob/main/lib/graph.dart"><code>lib/graph.dart</code></a>.
This is some code that was added for debugging.  It can display a graph of the velocity and
acceleration of the orbiting bodies.  

<h2>What's missing?</h2>
<p>
A lot is missing!  If you want to make this program better, grab a
copy and start playing.  Some things to consider...

<h3>Screen Size</h3>
<p>
You might notice that the app doesn't do anything intelligent about
the screen size.  Maybe there should be a way to change the 
scaling and scroll around,
so you can find things when they zoom of the screen?

<h3>Different Universes</h3>
<p>
Right now, there's just the one universe, with the Sun,
the Earth, Saturn and a little green comet.  It would be
nice to have other universes to pick from.

<h3>Simulation Accuracy</h3>
<p>
One of the earlier simulations had four equivalent bodies
that seem to behave the same way, until they don't.  We
talked about how this is a result of the limited <i>precision</i>
of the math that the computer does.  For example, the number
2/3 is represented in the computer as about
<code>0.66666666666666663</code>.  That's accurate to about 
sixteen decimal digits, which is pretty good.  But we're
re-calculating 10,000 times a second, so little errors add
up.
<p>
This kind of problem comes up in the field of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis">Numerical
Analysis</a>.
One thing you can do is to try adding more precision.  Instead of
numbers that are accurate to 16 decimal digits, you can try
with numbers accurate to 50 digits, or 100, or 1000.  This
might be an interesting thing to play with.  To do that, you'd
probably want to find a software library that offers
what's called <i>arbitrary precision</i> math operations.
One that looks promising is
<a href="https://pub.dev/packages/computable_reals"><code>computable_reals</code></a>.

<h3>Game?</h3>
<p>
Maybe the orbit calculations could be made into a game, by adding a spaceship
with a rocket whose force and direction can be controlled.

<h3>Others?</h3>
<p>
The beauty of writing software is that you can make it do whatever
you want!  All you need is a computer, some kind of development
environment, time, and patience.  Many wonderful development 
environments are available for free.  For Flutter,
<a href="https://flutter.dev">https://flutter.dev</a> can point
you to some.  If this little program seems fun, grab a copy and start
modifying it!
